Fetch indicators from a XML feed. The integration supports a large amount of user configurations to support different types of XML feeds.

* **URL** - URL of the feed.
* **Auto detect indicator type** - If checked, a type auto detection mechanism will take place for each indicator.
* **Indicator Type** - Type of the indicator in the feed. Relevant only if Auto detect is not checked. 
* **Username + Password** - Credentials to access feeds that require basic authentication. 
These fields also support the use of API key headers. To use API key headers, specify the header name and value in the following format:
`_header:<header_name>` in the **Username** field and the header value in the **Password** field.
* **JMESPath Extractor** - JMESPath expression for extracting the indicators from. You can check the expression in 
the [JMESPath site](http://jmespath.org/) to verify this expression will return the following array of objects.
* **XML Indicator Attribute** - JSON attribute whose value is the indicator. Default is 'indicator'.

## Step by step configuration
As an example, we'll be looking at CVE data feeds described here: https://cve.mitre.org/cve/data_feeds.html

**URL**: https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/xml/cve/misc/nvd-rss.xml

**Auto detect indicator type**: Checked.

**Indicator Type** - Leave it empty and let the system identify the indicator type.

**Credentials** - This feed does not require authentication.

From a quick look at the feed in the web browser, we are going to configure the rest of the parameters:

**JMESPath Extractor** - RDF.item

**XML Indicator Attribute** - Indicator

Now we have successfully configured an instance for the CVEs from the daily NIST feed.

By clicking `Mapping` in the integration instance, we can map the field names we previously configured to actual indicator fields (except `value` which is the indicator value).
We can use `Set up a new classification rule` using actual data from the feed.
