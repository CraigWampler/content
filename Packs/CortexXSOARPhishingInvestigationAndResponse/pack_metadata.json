    "description": "SlashNext Phishing Incident Response integration allows Cortex XSOAR users to fully automate analysis of suspicious URLs. For example, IR teams responsible for abuse inbox management can extract links or domains out of suspicious emails and automatically analyze them with the SlashNext SEER threat detection cloud to get definitive, binary verdicts (malicious or benign) along with IOCs, screen shots, and more. Automating URL analysis can save IR teams hundreds of hours versus manually triaging these emails or checking URLs and domains against less accurate phishing databases and domain reputation services.",
