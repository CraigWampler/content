comment: "The SecureHealthFirewallAPI is the facade to orchestrate automatically unprovisioning\
  \ a compromised device from the network and blocking further traffic to the IOC\
  \ by all assets on the same network.  \n\nThe device may also be notified (OPTIONAL)\
  \ that an incident has occurred and that the device will be collected by IT staff."
