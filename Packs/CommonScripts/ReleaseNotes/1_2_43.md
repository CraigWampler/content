##### New: pollingField
- This script will check that a field exists (and contains data) and optionally check the value of the field for a match against an input value. If a regex was not supplied, the script will checl that the field is not empty. This script can be used with the "GenericPolling" playbook to poll for field population or that a field contains a specific value.
